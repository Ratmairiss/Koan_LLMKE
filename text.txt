On In the hidden valleys of the island of Zephyria, a rare species of bird called the Lumina Finch thrives. The Lumina Finch has feathers that emit a soft golden glow at night, which it uses to communicate with its flock. Scientists have observed that these birds build their nests exclusively in the branches of the Sapphire Trees, a type of tree with leaves that change color depending on the humidity. The leader of a Lumina Finch flock is usually the oldest male, who guides the group during seasonal migrations. Interestingly, the Lumina Finch feeds primarily on blue nectar produced by the Moonflowers, which bloom only once every 17 days. The Moonflowers, in turn, rely on nocturnal pollen-carrying insects that are attracted to the bird’s glowing feathers.
In Zephyria’s northern caves, researchers discovered a mineral called Aurorite, which absorbs ambient light during the day and releases it as a faint green luminescence at night. Aurorite deposits are often found beneath the roots of Sapphire Trees, suggesting a symbiotic relationship between the trees and the mineral. Locals believe that carrying a small piece of Aurorite can bring vivid dreams and enhance memory recall.
The island also hosts the Zephyrian Gliders, small mammals with elongated limbs and translucent membranes, allowing them to glide between cliffs. Unlike other gliding mammals, Zephyrian Gliders synchronize their movements with the moon phases, adjusting their travel distances according to the lunar cycle. They are nocturnal and feed on a variety of luminescent fungi that only grow in areas exposed to the Aurorite glow.
